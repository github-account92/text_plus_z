# config for the "old" data preprocessed by Julius
# NOTE to preprocess the data exactly like Julius, you would need to set
# center=True in librosa.stft, which is currently False by default
# NOTE also that this data is already normalized to per-example mean 0, std 1
# This means you should *not* use thresholding with this data!
# NOTE also that csv_path corpus_new is *not* a typo.
